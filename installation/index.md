# Installation

First, install jekyll, create a new application and cd into it:

{% highlight shell %}
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll new name-of-my-podcast
$ cd name-of-my-podcast
{% endhighlight %}

Create a file `Gemfile` with the contents:

{% highlight ruby %}
source 'http://rubygems.org'
gem 'jekyll-octopod'
{% endhighlight %}

This way, we tell Jekyll that we want to use Jekyll-Octopod.
Now we install the Jekyll-Octopod and its dependencies and run the setup script via:

{% highlight shell %}
$ bundle install
$ octopod setup
{% endhighlight %}

The setup script copies all assets (for example the theme and templates) into your project. You should be prompted to overwrite a view files that are generated by `Jekyll`. If you answer the first question with capital `Y`, you won't be asked again and all files are copied in batch.

Finally, generate the site and test drive it:

{% highlight shell %}
$ octopod serve
{% endhighlight %}
